    "In theory, Python is completely platform neutral. That is, you can `open` a file on Linux/MacOS/Unix/Windows, iterate over it, read it, write to it, etc., and you won't feel any difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one big thing to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    " When you open a file in Windows, you need to use a backslash (`\\`), which you need to double in Python (`'\\\\'`) in order to have a single one. Or you can use a raw string, with `r` before the opening quote, which doubles it automatically. In Unix, we use `/` to separate folders/directories, but in Windows, we use `\\`, which makes things a bit uglier/more complicated from Python.\n",
