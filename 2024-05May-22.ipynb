    "In theory, Python is completely platform neutral. That is, you can `open` a file on Linux/MacOS/Unix/Windows, iterate over it, read it, write to it, etc., and you won't feel any difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one big thing to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    " When you open a file in Windows, you need to use a backslash (`\\`), which you need to double in Python (`'\\\\'`) in order to have a single one. Or you can use a raw string, with `r` before the opening quote, which doubles it automatically. In Unix, we use `/` to separate folders/directories, but in Windows, we use `\\`, which makes things a bit uglier/more complicated from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To practice, you'll want to either download/use some text files or create text files on your own. Feel free to download files from `https://files.lerner.co.il`; these are files that I use in my various courses, and if some of them are useful, then great.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with many files on Windows is that they're in a binary format, and so it's harder to read from them in Python. But maybe after today, when we see how to use packages, you'll be able to find one that makes it possible.\n"

    "We've seen, numerous times, in this course, that it pays for us to use the DRY (\"don't repeat yourself\") rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the same line of code repeats itself, then we can DRY up our code with a `for` loop.\n",
    "2. If the same code repeats itself within a program, then we can DRY up our code with a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many advantages to doing this:\n",
    "- We can think at a higher level\n",
    "- We write the code just once\n",
    "- We can maintain/update/optimize/debug the code in a single place\n",
    "- It's easier to think about the code, because there's less of a cognitive load\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third situation in which we might want to DRY up our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the same code repeats itself across multiple programs, then we can DRY up our code with a \"library.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries exist in many different programming languages. And the idea is that you write some functionality once, or you create a data structure once, and then you can use it across a wide variety of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we call our libraries \"modules.\" A module isn't just a library. It's also a *namespace*.\n",
    "\n",
    "By that, I mean that it allows us to divide our variable/function names into sub-segments. You can think of it as giving our variables last names (surnames), to avoid confusion -- or, as it's known in the trade, \"namespace collisions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly every Python program uses a number of modules. Many times, these modules come from Python's \"standard library,\" the modules that are installed along with the language. There are other, third-party modules that you can download and install -- and we'll talk about those, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can concentrate on the functionality that we want to create, rather than reinvent the wheel with each of our new programs. The fact that what is defined in a module stays in the module means that we can use multiple modules, and not worry about what names each of them is using, because the names will stay inside of those namespaces."

    "# How do we use a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module in Python, we use the `import` statement. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice some things about the `import` statement:\n",
    "1. It's not a function! We don't use `()` on the thing that comes to its right.\n",
    "2. The word to the right of `import` is not a string! It's not a filename! It's the name of the module variable we want to define, but it's also the name of the module's file (without the full `.py` suffix). We aren't telling Python what file to find or load (we are, but indirectly). Rather, we are indicating what variable we want to define.\n",
    "3. When we're done with the `import`, the variable is defined to contain a module.\n",
    "4. On that module object, we'll have attributes (i.e., names after a `.`) that contain values and functions."

    "# What have I done?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when we use `import`, Python does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It loads the module from disk into memory, and defines a module object.\n",
    "2. It assigns the module object to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say `import random`, it first loads the module and then assigns to the variable `random`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this has a pretty big flaw -- if I import the same module multiple times, that's a huge waste of resources. For that reason, Python only loads a module once, but it will assign teh variable every time you use `import`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `from .. import`, Python does exactly the same thing as usual, in terms of loading (or not) the module. The only difference is that it doesn't define a variable for the module. Rather, it defines a variable for whatever you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `from random import randint`:\n",
    "- If `random` was already loaded into memory, then Python ignores the loading. Otherwise, it loads it as necessary.\n",
    "- It then assigns the global variable `randint` to refer to the module's `randint` function.\n",
    "- It does *not* assign the variable `random` to a module object. If that was done before, then great.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things to remember about this:\n",
    "1. This means that the module, as a name, is not available. The module is loaded, but it's anonymous, and cannot be reached without `import random`.\n",
    "2. Using `from .. import` saves zero time and zero memory."
