    "In theory, Python is completely platform neutral. That is, you can `open` a file on Linux/MacOS/Unix/Windows, iterate over it, read it, write to it, etc., and you won't feel any difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one big thing to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    " When you open a file in Windows, you need to use a backslash (`\\`), which you need to double in Python (`'\\\\'`) in order to have a single one. Or you can use a raw string, with `r` before the opening quote, which doubles it automatically. In Unix, we use `/` to separate folders/directories, but in Windows, we use `\\`, which makes things a bit uglier/more complicated from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To practice, you'll want to either download/use some text files or create text files on your own. Feel free to download files from `https://files.lerner.co.il`; these are files that I use in my various courses, and if some of them are useful, then great.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with many files on Windows is that they're in a binary format, and so it's harder to read from them in Python. But maybe after today, when we see how to use packages, you'll be able to find one that makes it possible.\n"
