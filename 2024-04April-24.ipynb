The way that they did this was by separating the hardware (the physical computer) from the software (i.e., the instructions that we gave the computer). In this way, we could build a computer once, and use it many times for different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you give instructions to a computer? You could use 0s and 1s. Pretty soon, computer scientists came up with a better idea -- we write in a high-level \"language,\" and that language is then converted, or translated, into the 1s and 0s.\n",

    "A lot of the ease of learning Python comes from its consistency.  Once you learn something in Python, you can stick with that idea/syntax for the rest of your time using it.\n",
