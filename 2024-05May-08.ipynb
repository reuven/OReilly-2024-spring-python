    "\n",
    "We've talked about several data structures so far, for working with our information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `True`/`False`\n",
    "- Integers and floats\n",
    "- Sequences (i.e., iterable containers for other data)\n",
    "    - Strings\n",
    "    - Lists\n",
    "    - Tuples\n",
    " \n",
    "In all sequences, the values are indexed, starting at 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the index for a particular value, we can retrieve it from that string/list/tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we don't know the index? Then we can search! There is a `.index` method on all three of these data structures. Think about it, though -- that means running a `for` loop in order to find out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that sequences (especially lists) are really convenient and easy to work with! But (a) searching in them is slow and (b) the index doesn't really have any inherent meaning. It's just when we added something to the list.\n",

    "# Dictionaries (\"dicts\")\n",
    "\n",
    "These are, by far, the most powerful data structures in Python. They also exist in other languages. You might have heard of them as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hash tables\n",
    "- Hash maps\n",
    "- Hashes\n",
    "- Associative arrays\n",
    "- Key-value stores\n",
    "- Name-value stores\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea, though, is that instead of storing a single item (as we do with a string, list, tuple), we're going to store a *pair* of\n",
    "items, the key (which is what we call the index in a dict) and the value (which is... the value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of dict syntax, and then we'll actually do it\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a dictionary, we'll use `{}`\n",
    "- Inside of the `{}`, we'll have zero or more key-value pairs\n",
    "- Each key and value are separated by a `:`\n",
    "- Each pair is separated from other pairs with `,`\n",
    "\n",
    "What can be a key? What can be a value? Some basic rules:\n",
    "- Every key in a dict has a value, and every value has a key.\n",
    "- The key can be any immutable type in Python -- we normally use integers and strings\n",
    "- The value can be absolutely, positively any Python value -- int, string, float, list, dict, etc.\n",
    "- Keys must be unique within a dict. There can be no key duplication.\n",
    "- Values can repeat themselves, though.\n",
    "- You can get a value via the key, but you cannot get a key via the value (at least, not easily)."
